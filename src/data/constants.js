      "It is a simulation of a plane called a marker beacon. It uses a model plane with the sound of the frequency of the landing distance on the runway. How far is the aircraft parked before the runway to be the safest for pilots and passengers to land. It uses a model plane instead of moving into the runway and has an audio frequency circuit that uses moss code to represent the sound frequency. And there is a light next to the box to indicate three different levels of the marker beacon in each color. And there will be status indicator on the box as well. The use of this marker beacon model is that only a switch is a pushbutton of the operation, and the marker beacon model runs by itself. And it is consistent with the purpose of making the learner more aware of the structure and function of the marker beacon, as well as the operation of the aircraft navigation system.",
